Users can select from multiple intelligent display modes in the DJI Pilot flight control app to visualize data from the dual-sensor camera: FLIR MSX - A new feature that combines data from the visual and thermal cameras in real time to enhance visual details, helping pilots quickly identify and interpret critical data that may not be immediately visible to the naked eye. This Drone has features like Spot Meter - Displays the average temperature of an object, helping pilots monitor and measure critical or hazardous objects while maintaining a safe distance. Area Measurement - Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperature, as well as the corresponding locations of each area, allowing inspectors to quickly assess objects and determine if an asset may be overheating. Isotherm - Allows pilots to designate specific temperature ranges to be displayed using a custom color palette so objects within the range relay higher contrast and better visibility. This feature includes custom profiles to aid search and rescue pilots in identifying people and to help firefighters identify hot spots in fires, as well as a custom profile setting for added flexibility."

This affordable quadcopter has a 2x optical and 3x digital camera, allowing a broader view or a close-up look at developing situations or infrastructure. The camera shoots sharp 12 MP stills and vibration-free 4K ultra-high-definition video. It transmits live video over its full 4.97-mile range in 1080p high definition. It stays aloft for up to half an hour. Hover safely over wildfires or urban infernos. Perform search-and-rescue operations over limited-access terrain or bodies of water. Broadcast warnings or directions using the easily mounted loudspeaker. Record at night with Snap-on flood lamps. Observe suspects or track escapees. Get close to cell towers, high-tension lines, bridges and high-rise buildings without compromising worker safety. Examine storm-damaged roofs from the ground."

This drone may be small when compared to others on the market, but don\"t let that put you off as this little terrier of the sky has a bite bigger than its bark! Being a smaller drone though does have its advantages: compact and easy to store therefore saving space, easily carried/transported to remote areas without the use of vehicles, fit and access small spaces and tight spots, can be operated from small take-off/landing areas."

The batteries protect themselves from harmful power levels when stored. Mavic 2 batteries are interchangeable with those of the Mavic 2 Zoom and Mavic 2 Pro. The included Mavic 2 charger and available charging hub will charge the batteries of any Mavic 2 model. A full charge takes about an hour. A hub will charge up to four batteries in sequence, starting with the battery that has the highest reserve, then automatically moving on to the next highest."

This is true for both environmental research and agriculture. This drone can look below the surface since it has a gimbal with a 6-camera array. The other five cameras each capture a different wavelength, while one camera is an RGB camera that only records visible light and takes conventional images. The other five cameras record 2MP images in wavelengths including red edge, near-infrared, green, red, and blue. Even while flying at higher speeds, the resulting photographs are clear thanks to the global shutter and 3-axis stabilized gimbal. To maximize data collection and concentrate on the regions that require the most attention, you can flip between the two feeds while flying. An integrated spectral sunlight sensor on the top of the P4 Multispectral quadcopter works in conjunction with the gimbal camera to achieve the most accurate NDVI results possible. The sensor captures solar irradiance to help increase accuracy and maintain consistency in processed data through different times of the day."
