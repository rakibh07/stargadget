                "details": "The Dahua DH-HAC-HFW2401TP-Z-A HDCVI IR bullet camera includes many sensors and panoramic perspectives for wide-angle monitoring. With the ease of utilizing existing coaxial equipment, you may enjoy a 4-megapixel video. Even in severe low-light circumstances, the 4MP starlight HDCVI camera produces a high-quality image with rich details. Additionally, the camera has broadcast-quality audio for better additional evidence collecting. It comes in a variety of motorized/fixed lens variants with a real WDR of 120dB and HD/SD switchable output. The 4MP HDCVI camera's greater resolution and starlight capability make it an excellent choice for mid-to-large-sized organizations and projects that require both highly dependable monitoring and construction flexibility. The Dahua DH-HAC-HFW2401TP-Z-A 4MP Water-Proof HDCVI IR bullet camera retains the inherent simplicity of classic analog surveillance systems, making it an excellent option for protecting your investment. Without replacing existing coaxial wiring, the HDCVI system may smoothly modernize the previous analog system. The plug-and-play method allows for full HD video monitoring without the need to set up a network. Even in the most strong contrast lighting circumstances, vibrant visuals are created thanks to industry-leading wide dynamic range (WDR) technology. True WDR (120dB) optimizes both the bright and dark regions of a scene simultaneously, resulting in useable footage. The Dahua DH-HAC-HFW2401TP-Z-A 4MP Water-Proof HDCVI IR bullet camera has advanced 3DNR. 3DNR is a noise reduction technique that compares two successive frames to identify and remove random disturbances. Dahua's sophisticated 3DNR technology achieves outstanding noise reduction with minimal loss of clarity, even in low-light situations. Furthermore, the sophisticated 3DNR significantly reduces bandwidth while saving storage space. Because of its durable build, the camera has unrivaled dependability. With an IP67 rating, the camera is water and dust-resistant, making it appropriate for both indoor and outdoor use. With a 30 percent input voltage tolerance, this camera is suitable for even the most insecure power source. The camera and its construction are protected from the impacts of lightning thanks to its 4KV lightning certification. The Dahua DH-HAC-HFW2401TP-Z-A 4MP Water-Proof HDCVI IR bullet camera comes with a 01-year warranty."
