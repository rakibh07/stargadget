Upgraded with 2nd-gen Razer Optical Switches, itâ€™s time to rise to the occasion and leave it all on the floor. Razer HyperPolling Technology surpasses the industry standard with a true 8000 Hz polling rateâ€” sending up to 8 times more data in a second and reducing delay from 1 to 1/8th of a millisecond. Unlike mice with lower polling rates where cursor movement can exhibit inconsistent micro-stutters, Razer HyperPolling Technology ensures ultra-smooth cursor movement in a difference thatâ€™s even more apparent on high refresh rate monitors. Improved with greater tactile feedback, every click now feels and sounds more satisfying. And with no need for a debounce delay used in traditional switches, this lightning-fast actuation is complemented by Razer HyperPolling Technology to provide the lowest input latency that gets you closer to playing like a pro. With an industry-leading 99.6% resolution accuracy, even the finest movement from this ambidextrous esports gaming mouse is tracked with consistency. Equipped with intelligent functions, the sensor becomes even more accurate, allowing for an acute level of precision for game-winning headshots. Enjoy faster and smoother control with one of the lightest gaming mice in the market. Weighing just 71g, whatâ€™s even more impressive is that it achieves its weight without compromising on the build strength of its ambidextrous form factor. Be ready to compete anywhere with up to 5 stored profiles that give you access to optimal key binds, macros, and twice the inputs via the Razer HyperShift function. This latest Razer Viper 8KHz Ambidextrous Esports Gaming Mouse has 01 Year Warranty (Need to submit product box for warranty claim)."
