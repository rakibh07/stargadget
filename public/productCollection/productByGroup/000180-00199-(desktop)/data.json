                "details": "The Apple Mac mini is now equipped with Apple's pro-level M2 chip, making it suited for a variety of jobs like editing huge photos and 8K ProRes video as well as more demanding applications like immersive gaming and rich presentations. The Apple M2, which makes use of 2nd-Generation 5nm process technology, merges the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O, and more into a single system on a chip (SoC). Users will be able to concurrently playback up to two streams of 8K ProRes 422 video at 30 frames per second or up to 12 streams of 4K ProRes 422 video at 30 frames per second, which is an increase of up to 2.4x over the previous generation Mac mini with M1. Filter and function performance in Adobe Photoshop is also boosted up to 50%. This is possible thanks to the M2's faster next-generation CPU and GPU, higher bandwidth memory, and a more powerful media engine for improved performance and power efficiency that includes an advanced thermal system for greater sustained performance. Adding to the Mac mini's power is 8GB of RAM and, thanks to the addition of Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), wireless networking will operate at up to 2.4 Gb/s. The 10-Core GPU produces images that are crisp and clear, and you can export video to an external monitor using either the built-in HDMI port or the system's Thunderbolt 4 ports, which support native DisplayPort output. With one 6K/60Hz monitor using Thunderbolt 4 and a second 5K/60Hz display using Thunderbolt 4, or a 4K/60Hz display using HDMI, this Mac mini enables up to two simultaneous displays. A 512GB SSD is included in this Mac mini for file storage. There are two Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 ports, 10 Gb/s USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, charging ports, and power ports for external peripherals if you want to add external peripherals. There are still two 5 Gb/s USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports available for connecting additional devices to this machine. For wired networking, a Gigabit Ethernet connector is already there. Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) can be used for wireless access. You can connect more compatible devices, such as keyboards, mice, and headsets, using Bluetooth 5.3 technology. Using a 3.5mm headphone jack, the sound is output. An integrated 150W power supply that uses 100-240 VAC at 50-60 Hz powers Apple's Mac mini."
