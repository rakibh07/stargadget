It is equipped with advanced 4th Generation Tensor Cores for up to 2X AI performance and 3rd Generation RT Cores for up to 2X ray tracing performance. GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4090 GAMING OC 24G is equipped with some special features such as a WINDFORCE cooling system, RGB Fusion, 4 video outputs, and a Protection metal backplate. The WINDFORCE cooling system features three 110mm newly designed bionic shark fans, alternate spinning, 13 composite copper heat pipes, a large vapor chamber directly touching the GPU, 3D active fans, and Screen cooling, which together provide high-efficiency heat dissipation. The double ball bearing structure has better heat endurance and efficiency than the sleeve structure. The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. The legendary three-ring lighting provides excellent visual enjoyment. You can choose any lighting effect or synchronize it with other devices in the GIGABYTE CONTROL CENTER. The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4090 GAMING OC 24GB Graphics Card features Dual Bios. The factory default setting is OC mode, which provides users with the best performance. However, switching to silent mode will enjoy a quieter experience. The metal backplate not only provides an aesthetical shape but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection. The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4090 GAMING OC 24G comes with 3 years of warranty."
