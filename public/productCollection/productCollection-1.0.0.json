This PSU features a dual ball bearing setup that will last up to twice as long as a sleeve bearing design. ROG heat-sinks cover critical components. Lower temps result in a longer lifespan and reduced noise. The Power supply comes with an onboard controller that brings the 135mm fan to a standstill when total draw power (TDP) is below 40%, letting you enjoy light gaming in relative silence. Above 40% TDP, the fans automatically start up again. The integrated ROG heat-sinks have 2x more volume than traditional designs, resulting in significantly lower temperatures inside Strix PSUs. This extends the lifespan of components and allows 0dB operation for a longer duration than standard designs. ASUS ROG Strix 1000G 1000W 80 Plus Gold Power Supply's heat-sinks are so effective that fan noise stays whisper quiet, even under full load. Axial-tech fan design features a smaller fan hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring that increases downward air pressure. It supports cosmetic customization that is enabled by a magnetic logo and stickers that help you re-skin the visible side to your liking.  It has earned an 80 Plus Gold Certification as the result of Japanese capacitors and other premium components. It ensures reliability and comes with a 10-year warranty."

Razer HyperPolling Technology surpasses the industry standard with a true 8000 Hz polling rateÃ¢â¬â sending up to 8 times more data in a second and reducing delay from 1 to 1/8th of a millisecond.

Improved with greater tactile feedback, every click now feels and sounds more satisfying. And with no need for a debounce delay used in traditional switches, this lightning-fast actuation is complemented by Razer HyperPolling Technology to provide the lowest input latency that gets you closer to playing like a pro. With an industry-leading 99.6% resolution accuracy, even the finest movement from this ambidextrous esports gaming mouse is tracked with consistency. Equipped with intelligent functions, the sensor becomes even more accurate, allowing for an acute level of precision for game-winning headshots. Enjoy faster and smoother control with one of the lightest gaming mice in the market. Weighing just 71g, whatÃ¢â¬â¢s even more impressive is that it achieves its weight without compromising on the build strength of its ambidextrous form factor.

The Apple M2, which makes use of 2nd-Generation 5nm process technology, merges the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O, and more into a single system on a chip (SoC). Users will be able to concurrently playback up to two streams of 8K ProRes 422 video at 30 frames per second or up to 12 streams of 4K ProRes 422 video at 30 frames per second, which is an increase of up to 2.4x over the previous generation Mac mini with M1. Filter and function performance in Adobe Photoshop is also boosted up to 50%. This is possible thanks to the M2's faster next-generation CPU and GPU, higher bandwidth memory, and a more powerful media engine for improved performance and power efficiency that includes an advanced thermal system for greater sustained performance. Adding to the Mac mini's power is 8GB of RAM and, thanks to the addition of Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), wireless networking will operate at up to 2.4 Gb/s. The 10-Core GPU produces images that are crisp and clear, and you can export video to an external monitor using either the built-in HDMI port or the system's Thunderbolt 4 ports, which support native DisplayPort output. With one 6K/60Hz monitor using Thunderbolt 4 and a second 5K/60Hz display using Thunderbolt 4, or a 4K/60Hz display using HDMI, this Mac mini enables up to two simultaneous displays. A 512GB SSD is included in this Mac mini for file storage. There are two Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 ports, 10 Gb/s USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, charging ports, and power ports for external peripherals if you want to add external peripherals. There are still two 5 Gb/s USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports available for connecting additional devices to this machine. For wired networking, a Gigabit Ethernet connector is already there. Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) can be used for wireless access. You can connect more compatible devices, such as keyboards, mice, and headsets, using Bluetooth 5.3 technology. Using a 3.5mm headphone jack, the sound is output. An integrated 150W power supply that uses 100-240 VAC at 50-60 Hz powers Apple's Mac mini."

It comes with a fully closed air guide louver & top-mounted filter. This AC features an auto-clean function that will prevent the growth of harmful micro-organisms by eliminating the moisture inside the indoor unit. Your indoor unit evaporates the moisture inside of the unit. Activate this function to provide you with more clean and healthier air. The Gree GS-30XFV32 has the \"I Feel\" feature that incorporates two temperature sensors, one on the unit and the other on the remote handset. In this mode, the indoor blower in an AC runs for a few minutes even after the air conditioner is switched off. This helps keep the indoor coil dry and prevents dust or mold accumulation. It can reduce energy loss and defrost time by only defrosting when needed instead of by a set timer. The sleep mode on an air conditioner is designed so as to give you comfort during your sleep by increasing the temperature every hour as you require less cooling while asleep as your body gets cold. It offers comfortable airflow and a wide air supply while having a quiet design. The AC is featured with Ai intelligent control. It has a WiFi remote control for long-distance control of the unit for on and off, temperature and fan speed, etc. with a mobile phone WiFi. The Gree GS-30XFV32 comes with 10 Year Compressor Warranty. (The warranty card must be kept for any warranty claim.)\n\nInstallation and delivery charges must be paid by the customer. Delivery and installation charges may vary due to location and building height."

This is true for both environmental research and agriculture. This drone can look below the surface since it has a gimbal with a 6-camera array. The other five cameras each capture a different wavelength, while one camera is an RGB camera that only records visible light and takes conventional images. The other five cameras record 2MP images in wavelengths including red edge, near-infrared, green, red, and blue. Even while flying at higher speeds, the resulting photographs are clear thanks to the global shutter and 3-axis stabilized gimbal. To maximize data collection and concentrate on the regions that require the most attention, you can flip between the two feeds while flying. An integrated spectral sunlight sensor on the top of the P4 Multispectral quadcopter works in conjunction with the gimbal camera to achieve the most accurate NDVI results possible. The sensor captures solar irradiance to help increase accuracy and maintain consistency in processed data through different times of the day."
